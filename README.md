# PYVOXEL-Procedural-World
A Python-based procedural voxel world generator creates a 3D environment using cubes (voxels) to simulate terrain, structures, and landscapes similar to games like Minecraft. The generator uses algorithms such as Perlin noise, simplex noise, or diamond-square to generate realistic terrain features, including mountains, valleys, plains, and caves, by assigning height and biome values to each voxel. 

# Key features include:
- **3D Chunk-Based Generation**: The world is divided into chunks (typically 16x16x256 or customizable sizes), allowing for infinite generation and efficient memory use.
- **Biomes**: Different biomes such as forests, deserts, oceans, and snowy areas are generated based on noise maps, affecting block types (e.g., grass, sand, stone).
- **Terrain Features**: The system dynamically creates varying elevations, caves, and overhangs, adding natural-looking landscapes with distinct geological formations.
- **Procedural Structures**: The generator can spawn procedurally created structures like trees, villages, or dungeons at random locations within the world.
- **Lighting and Shadows**: Basic ambient lighting is applied to enhance visual realism with simple voxel lighting models.
- **Player Interaction**: The player can mine and place blocks, interacting with the voxel world in real-time, with modifications seamlessly integrated into the terrain generation.

This procedural voxel world generation code can be implemented in Python using libraries like **Pygame** or **PyOpenGL** for rendering, or using **numPy** for efficient voxel storage and manipulation.
